**Welcome to Chenfei Qu's page!**

I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Energy, Environment, and Economy, Tsinghua University. 

My primary research interests are in carbon pricing and emissions trading policies, climate change policy, air pollution, and Integrated Assessment Models for Climate Change. In my research, I often build and utilize computable general equilibrium models as well as integrated assessment models to conduct analysis. I also have experience in conducting meta-analyses with Stata and R.

You can find my [CV](../assets/QU_Chenfei_CV.pdf) here.
