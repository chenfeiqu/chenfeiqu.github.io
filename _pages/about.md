**Welcome to Chenfei Qu's page!**

I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Energy, Environment, and Economy, Tsinghua University. 

My primary research interests are in carbon pricing and emissions trading policies, climate change policy, air pollution, and Integrated Assessment Models for Climate Change. In my research, I oftern build and use computable general equilibrium models and integrated assessment models for analysis, and also have experience in meta-analysis.
