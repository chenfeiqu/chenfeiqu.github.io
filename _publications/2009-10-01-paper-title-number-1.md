China’s recently launched CO2 emissions trading system, already the world’s largest, aims to contribute importantly toward global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  The system, a tradable performance standard (TPS), differs importantly from cap and trade (C&T), the principal emissions trading approach used in other countries.  We offer a dynamic general equilibrium assessment of this new venture, employing a model that uniquely considers institutional and fiscal features of China’s economy that influence economy-wide policy costs and distributional impacts.

Key findings include the following.  The TPS’s environmental benefits exceed its costs by a factor of five when only the climate-related benefits are considered and by a significantly higher factor when health benefits from improved air quality are included.  The TPS’s interactions with China’s fiscal system substantially affect its costs relative to those of C&T.  Employing a single benchmark for the electricity sector would lower costs by over a third percent relative to the four-benchmark system that is actually in place but increase the standard deviation of percentage income losses across provinces by more than 60 percent.  Introducing an auction as a complementary source of allowance supply can lower economy-wide costs by at least 30 percent.
